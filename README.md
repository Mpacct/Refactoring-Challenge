# <Refactoring-Challenging>

## Description

In this challenge I cleaned up both the HTML and CSS files, adding comments to show each change I made.  I made the HTML document and CSS file follow logical flow, and ensured each item was represented as a correct element, class, or ID while maintaining correct deployment and accessibility of the website.  I cleaned up non-needed code to reduce duplications and accessibility of the user.  I commented what each selector does in CSS.
